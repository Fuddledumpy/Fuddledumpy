- 👋 Hi, I’m @stevenfarless
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself Python and Javascript (along with refreshers on HTML & CSS).
- 💻 I'm slowly working my way through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), [Mimo](https://mimo.org), and various learning/research rabbit trails.
- ☁ I intend to get into full stack web development in the near future.
